## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- # 🚀 Navigator 2.0: The Sentient Interface SDK

  This is a landmark architectural release that transforms Navigator from a gesture-control library into a complete **Sentient Interface SDK** - the first framework that understands and adapts to user behavior in real-time.

  ## 🧠 Revolutionary Architecture

  ### The Cognitive Loop

  Navigator 2.0 introduces the **Cognitive Loop** - a continuous cycle of perception, interpretation, and adaptation that makes web interfaces truly intelligent:
  - **Perception Layer**: Multi-modal input processing (gestures, keyboard, voice)
  - **Cognitive Layer**: Real-time behavioral modeling and intent prediction
  - **Adaptation Layer**: Dynamic UI responses based on user cognitive state

  ### Event-Driven Core

  Complete rewrite of the core architecture:
  - Unified event bus with type-safe messaging
  - Plugin Development Kit (PDK) for extensibility
  - Framework-agnostic design (works with React, Vue, Vanilla JS)
  - Zero-dependency core for maximum portability

  ## ✨ Major New Features

  ### 🎯 Cognitive Intelligence
  - **Behavioral Modeling**: Learns from user patterns and adapts in real-time
  - **Intent Prediction**: Anticipates user actions before they happen
  - **Cognitive State Tracking**: Monitors focus, hesitation, and exploration patterns
  - **Adaptive HUD**: Context-aware interface that responds to user behavior

  ### 🔌 Plugin Ecosystem
  - **@navigator.menu/pdk**: Official Plugin Development Kit
  - **@navigator.menu/plugin-cognitive**: Cognitive modeling and behavioral AI
  - **@navigator.menu/plugin-dom-renderer**: Smart DOM manipulation engine
  - **@navigator.menu/plugin-keyboard**: Spatial keyboard navigation
  - **@navigator.menu/plugin-logger**: Development and debugging utilities

  ### ⚛️ Framework Integration
  - **@navigator.menu/react**: React hooks and components (BYOS - Bring Your Own State)
  - **@navigator.menu/vue**: Vue 3 composables (coming soon)
  - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

  ### 🛠️ Developer Experience
  - **@navigator.menu/cli**: Project scaffolding and development tools
  - **@navigator.menu/create-navigator-app**: One-command project initialization
  - Comprehensive documentation and examples
  - Hot-reload development mode

  ## 🔧 Breaking Changes

  This is a complete architectural rewrite. If you're upgrading from Navigator 1.x:
  1. **New Package Names**: All packages now use the `@navigator.menu` scope
  2. **Event System**: Migrated to a unified event bus (see migration guide)
  3. **Plugin API**: Plugins now use the standardized PDK interface
  4. **Framework Wrappers**: React integration now follows BYOS pattern

  ## 📚 Migration Guide

  ## 🎨 What Makes This Special

  Navigator 2.0 doesn't just process inputs - it **understands users**. It's the difference between a reactive interface that responds to clicks, and a **sentient interface** that anticipates needs, adapts to behavior, and becomes smarter over time.

  This is the SDK for building the next generation of web experiences.

  ## 🙏 Acknowledgments

  Built with the vision of making web interfaces truly intelligent. Thank you to everyone who believed in this journey.
