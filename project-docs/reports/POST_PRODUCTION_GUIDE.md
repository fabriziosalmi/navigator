## 🎨 FASE 2: Post-Production Checklist

### Video Editing (Required)

#### 1. Import the Raw Video
- Open your video editor (DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, iMovie, etc.)
- Import `navigator-demo-raw-20251111-162236.webm`

#### 2. Trim & Clean
- ✂️ **Cut** the first ~1 second (loading phase)
- ✂️ **Cut** the last ~1 second (ending)
- Target final length: **15-18 seconds** (perfect for social media)

#### 3. Add Background Music 🎵
**CRITICAL FOR VIBE!**

Suggested tracks (royalty-free):
- **Synthwave/Electronic**: Search for "cyberpunk background music" on YouTube Audio Library
- **Tempo**: 120-140 BPM
- **Volume**: Keep at 30-40% so narration/sound effects can be added later
- **Fade in/out**: 0.5s at start and end

Recommended sources:
- YouTube Audio Library (free, no attribution required)
- Uppbeat (free tier available)
- Epidemic Sound (paid but professional)

#### 4. Add Text Overlays 📝
**Minimalist style - only 3 overlays:**

| Timestamp | Text | Position | Style |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| 3s | `CONCENTRATED` | Top-right | Cyan (#06b6d4), fade in 0.3s |
| 8s | `FRUSTRATED` | Top-right | Red (#ef4444), fade in 0.3s |
| 13s | `ADAPTING IN REAL-TIME` | Center | Purple (#a78bfa), fade in 0.5s |

**Font**: `Roboto Mono` or `JetBrains Mono` (monospace for tech vibe)  
**Size**: 48px  
**Duration**: Each overlay stays for 2-3 seconds

#### 5. Export Settings

**For YouTube/LinkedIn (.mp4):**
```
Format: MP4 (H.264)
Resolution: 1920x1080
Frame Rate: 30fps
Bitrate: 8-10 Mbps (VBR)
Audio: AAC, 192 kbps
```

**For Twitter/README (.gif):**
```
Resolution: 1280x720 (reduces file size)
Frame Rate: 15fps (smooth enough, smaller file)
Colors: 256 (standard for GIF)
Loop: Infinite
Max file size: <3MB for Twitter
```

Use [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) for .mp4 → .gif conversion with optimization.

## 📸 Create Screenshots

### From navigator.menu landing page:

1. **Hero Section** (Full width)
   - Show the main tagline + visualization
   - File: `hero-screenshot.png`

2. **The Three Pillars** (Full section)
   - Empathy Engine + Intent Prediction + Adaptive UI
   - File: `pillars-screenshot.png`

3. **Code Example** (Code block)
   - The minimal React integration example
   - File: `code-example-screenshot.png`

**Tool**: Use Firefox's built-in screenshot tool (Shift+Cmd+S on Mac) for pixel-perfect captures.

## 🚀 FASE 3: Prepare the Launch Kit

### File Checklist

After editing, you should have:

- [ ] `navigator-demo-final.mp4` (15-18s, with music + overlays)
- [ ] `navigator-demo-final.gif` (<3MB, optimized for social)
- [ ] `hero-screenshot.png`
- [ ] `pillars-screenshot.png`
- [ ] `code-example-screenshot.png`

### Hacker News

**Title**:
```
Show HN: Navigator.Menu - Open-source SDK for sentient web interfaces
```

**Body**:
```
I've built an SDK that lets web interfaces adapt to user behavior in real-time.

It analyzes patterns (speed, errors, hesitation) and emits cognitive state changes (concentrated, frustrated, learning). Your UI can then respond - faster animations for power users, slower transitions when users struggle.

Live demo: https://navigator.menu
GitHub: https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/navigator

Tech stack: TypeScript, event-driven architecture, framework-agnostic plugins.

Would love feedback from HN! What use cases do you see for this?

### LinkedIn

**Post**:
```
🧠 What if your web app could read the user's mind?

I spent the last few weeks building Navigator.Menu - an open-source SDK that detects user cognitive states and adapts the interface in real-time.

Watch this 15-second demo to see it in action:

[Attach: navigator-demo-final.mp4]

The SDK analyzes:
• Action speed & patterns
• Error rates
• Navigation hesitation

Then emits state changes:
🎯 Concentrated → Faster UI
😤 Frustrated → Slower, helpful UI
🧠 Learning → Balanced guidance

Built with TypeScript. Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS.

Open source: https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/navigator
Try it: https://navigator.menu

### Twitter/X

**Tweet 1** (Main announcement):
```
I built an SDK that lets your web app detect user frustration and adapt in real-time.

It's like giving your interface empathy.

Open source 👉 https://navigator.menu

```

**Tweet 2** (Thread continuation):
```
How it works:

1️⃣ Tracks user behavior (speed, errors, patterns)
2️⃣ Emits cognitive states (concentrated, frustrated, learning)
3️⃣ Your UI responds (faster animations vs. helpful slowdowns)

Framework-agnostic. Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS.

[Showoff Saturday] I built an SDK that gives web interfaces "empathy" - it detects user frustration and adapts the UI
```

**Body**:
```
Hey r/webdev!

I've been working on Navigator.Menu - an event-driven SDK that tracks user behavior and emits cognitive state changes.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes action speed, error rates, navigation patterns
- Detects states: concentrated, frustrated, learning, neutral
- Lets your UI adapt in real-time (faster animations for power users, slower helpful transitions when users struggle)

**Demo video:** [Attach: navigator-demo-final.mp4]

**Tech:**
- TypeScript, event-driven architecture
- Framework-agnostic plugins (React, Vue, vanilla)
- Zero AI/ML - pure algorithmic pattern detection
- MIT licensed

**Links:**
- Landing page: https://navigator.menu
- GitHub: https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/navigator

I'd love your feedback! What do you think about adaptive UIs?
